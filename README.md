# project-releases

This repository is for tracking and reporting updates for open-source packages that Quansight employees have contributed to. These are packages like NumPy, SciPy, Scikit-learn, Dask, among many others. We aim to report updates from these libararies in the form of a monthly or bi-monthly post to be hosted [here](https://www.quansight.com/blog).
